# Project description
The Mobile VR Camera is an app for Android devices that easily allows for conversion of any pair of smartphones into a stereoscopic camera system. After connecting two phones via Bluetooth, photos can be taken by simply holding the devices in parallel towards your desired target and pressing the trigger button. The app will then create your VR-suitable image.
Easily create VR-suitable photos and show them your friends. Never miss out on the opportunity to capture your most precious moments and relive them in Virtual Reality with the help of the Mobile VR Camera!

# MobileVRCamera Data protection

MobileVRCamera is developed by Felix and Christian

MobileVRCamera accesses and records camera sensor and microphone data, which is used for the purpose of taking photos, to fulfil its purpose as a camera. Microphone permission had to be asked to use the camera features we need.

MobileVRCamera requires permission to "access photos, media and files on your devices" (storage permission), as this permission is required for Android to save resultant files such as photos and videos to your device.

Bluetooth permissions are used to allow the stereo image caputure feature to discover and connect to Bluetooth devices; the Bluetooth remote control feature also requires location permission (on Android 11 or earlier) or Nearby Devices permission (on Android 12 or later).

Resultant data such as photos or videos can be shared with other apps if you use the share option in MobileVRCamera, or when MobileVRCamera is called by another app on your device, or when you use the Storage Access Framework option to save to another app or service.

Data handling procedures, data retention and deletion policies: MobileVRCamera a does not transmit personal or sensitive information to us.
